Learn how to set up your own kafka cluster on a Virtual Machine
(in this example using Ubuntu OS). But first things first, let's
talk about Kafka.

## Kafka

**Apache Kafka** is a distributed message broker designed to handle 
large volumes of real-time data efficiently. 
Unlike traditional brokers like **ActiveMQ** and **RabbitMQ**, 
Kafka runs as a cluster of one or more servers which makes 
it highly scalable and due to this distributed nature it 
has inbuilt fault-tolerance while delivering higher throughput 
when compared to its counterparts.

This message system comes up with various advanced features 
like built in partition, inherent fault tolerance, 
and replication which make it a good fit for 
large scale message processing business applications. 
Distributed application in the Kafka messaging is 
built on reliable message queuing architecture.
